== Introduction ==
This project provies a fully compliant BPEL4WS 1.1 and WS-BPEL 2.0 engine. 
The code here is based on the final release of ActiveBPEL 5.0.2. The goal of 
bpel-g is to provide a viable BPEL engine for the open source community, particularly
those in the public sector. The main focus is spec compliance. 

== Caveats ==
The packaging here is still very much a work in progress. There is a script for an H2 database which you'll need to run in order to setup the persistence layer. A future checkin will include a profile for running in persistence mode versus in-memory.
